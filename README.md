# IN-SILICO-IDENTIFICATION-AND-ANALYSIS-OF-CANCER-CAUSING-SMAD4-AND-ERBB2-GENE-VARIANTS

•	Classified nsSNPs from dbSNP for target genes and employed bioinformatics tools to identify cancer-associated deleterious SNPs, analyzing their functional and structural impacts. Conducted detailed analysis of deleterious SNPs, providing insights for further research.

•	Identified five nsSNPs of SMAD4 and two nsSNPs of ERBB2, prompting further investigation to determine their functional implications on metabolic phenotypes.
